1502	idr0028-pascualvargas-rhogtpases	RNAi screens for Rho GTPase regulators of cell shape and YAP/TAZ localisation in triple negative breast cancer.	In order to metastasize triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) must make dynamic changes in cell shape. The shape of all eukaryotic cells is regulated by Rho GTP Exchange Factors (RhoGEFs), which activate Rho-family GTPases in response to mechanical and informational cues. In contrast, Rho GTPase-activating proteins (RhoGAPs) inhibit Rho GTPases. However, which RhoGEFs and RhoGAPS couple TNBC cell shape to changes in their environment is very poorly understood. Moreover, whether the activity of particular RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs become dysregulated as cells evolve the ability to metastasise is not clear. Towards the ultimate goal of identifying RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs that are essential for TNBC metastasis, we performed an RNAi screen to isolate RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs that contribute to the morphogenesis of the highly metastatic TNBC cell line LM2, and its less-metastatic parental cell line MDA-MB-231. For ~6 million cells from each cell line we measured 127 different features following the depletion of 142 genes. Using a linear classifier scheme we also describe the morphological heterogeneity of each gene-depleted population.Version HistoryJuly 2017: Replaced cell line name of MDA-MB-231 with MDAMB231 in screens C and D to be inline with EFO cell line name.

To systematically assess cell-to-cell phenotypic variability, we combined automated yeast genetics, high-content screening and neural network-based image analysis of single cells, focussing on genes that influence the architecture of four subcellular compartments of the endocytic pathway as a model system. Our unbiased assessment of the morphology of these compartments — endocytic patch, actin patch, late endosome and vacuole — identified 17 distinct mutant phenotypes associated with ~1,600 genes (~30% of all yeast genes). Approximately half of these mutants exhibited multiple phenotypes, highlighting the extent of morphological pleiotropy. Quantitative analysis also revealed that incomplete penetrance was prevalent, with the majority of mutants exhibiting substantial variability in phenotype at the single-cell level. Our single-cell analysis enabled exploration of factors that contribute to incomplete penetrance and cellular heterogeneity, including replicative age, organelle inheritance and response to stress.

2651	idr0088-cox-phenomicprofiling/screenA	Tales of 1,008 Small Molecules: Phenomic Profiling through Live-cell Imaging in a Panel of Reporter Cell Lines	We screened a library of 1,008 approved drugs and well-characterized tool compounds manually annotated to 218 unique mechanisms-of-action (MoA) and 169 natural products at four concentrations with four replicates each in live-cell, high-content imaging screens against a panel of 15 reporter cell lines, which expressed a diverse set of fluorescent organelle and pathway markers in three distinct cell lineages. Each reporter cell line carried a BFP segmentation cassette that enabled detection of the nuclear and cell boundaries. In addition, each reporter cell line expressed a GFP- and a RFP/FusionRed-tagged organelle or pathway marker from its endogenous chromosomal locus. These markers were selected to cover a broad array of organelles, cellular structures and regulatory pathways for the generation of information-rich image-based compound descriptors.	Screen

Small intestinal organoids derived from four individual C57BL/6J mice were passaged by rigourous pipetting to nearly single cells at 1:4 ratio and seeded in 40µl Matrigel droplets/well in pre-warmed 24-well plates. 250µl/well basal organoid culture medium containing EGF, Noggin, and R-Spondin-1 (""ENR"") was added immediately after Matrigel solidification. 250µl/well ENR + probes from the SGC Epigenetics Probes library at 2x working concentration were added within 30min. For each biological replicate DMSO vehicle controls were carried out in quadruplicates and valproic acid (VPA) was included as positive control. Media was replaced after 48h. Organoid bright-field image stacks were acquired 0h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h after seeding on an EVOS2 microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific)."	Screen

2601	idr0094-ellinger-sarscov2	A SARS-CoV-2 cytopathicity dataset generated by high-content screening of a large drug repurposing collection	To identify possible candidates for progression towards clinical studies against SARS-CoV-2, we screened a well-defined collection of 5632 compounds including 3488 compounds which have undergone clinical investigations (marketed drugs, phases 1 -3, and withdrawn) across 600 indications. Compounds were screened for their inhibition of viral induced cytotoxicity using the human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 and a SARS-CoV-2 isolate. The primary screen of 5632 compounds gave 271 hits. A total of 64 compounds with IC50 <20 μM were identified, including 19 compounds with IC50 < 1 μM. Of this confirmed hit population, 90% have not yet been previously reported as active against SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro cell assays. Some 37 of the actives are launched drugs, 19 are in phases 1-3 and 10 pre-clinical. Several inhibitors were associated with modulation of host pathways including kinase signaling P53 activation, ubiquitin pathways and PDE activity modulation, with long chain acyl transferases were effective viral inhibitors.

2801	idr0097-reicher-proteintag/screenA	Pooled protein tagging, cellular imaging, and in situ sequencing for monitoring drug action in real time	We use CRISPR-Cas9 based intron tagging to generate cell pools expressing more than 900 GFP-fusion proteins (one GFP-tagged protein per cell). From that pool we isolated and imaged 720 clonal cell lines (one clonal cell line per well, 5 fields of view per well). Additionally, we sequenced the expressed intron-targeting sgRNA in each clone to identify the tagged protein in each clone. For 335 clonal cell lines our sgRNA amplicon sequencing strategy unambiguously identified the integrated sgRNAs indicating a single tagged protein, while in the remaining wells we could not unambiguisly identify the taged protein ('0' values in the respective columns in the library file). We then manually annotated the subcellular the subcellular protein localization of GFP-tagged protein to later compare them to antibody-based annotations available on The Human Protein Atlas.	Screen

3201	idr0120-german-immunologicalsynapse	Morphological profiling of human T and NK lymphocytes by high-content cell imaging	The immunological synapse is a complex structure that decodes stimulatory signals into adapted lymphocyte responses. As such, it represents a unique window to monitor lymphocyte activity, owing to the development of systematic quantitative approaches applicable to primary cells. Here we demonstrate the applicability of high-content imaging to human T and NK cells and develop a pipeline for unbiased analysis of high-definition morphological profiles. Our approach reveals how distinct facets of actin cytoskeleton remodeling shape immunological synapse architecture and impact lytic granule positioning. Morphological profiling of CD8+ T cells from immunodeficient patients allows discriminating the roles of the ARP2/3 subunit ARPC1B and the ARP2/3 activator WASP in immunological synapse assembly. Single cell analysis further identifies uncoupling of lytic granules and F-actin radial distribution in ARPC1B-deficient lymphocytes. Our study provides a foundation for the development of morphological profiling as a scalable approach to monitor primary lymphocyte responsiveness and to identify complex aspects of lymphocyte micro-architecture.

3108	idr0128-georgi-influenza	Parallel compound screen for infection modulators identifies re-purposing candidates against common viral infections	Viral infectious diseases span a myriad of maladies, including immunosuppression, cancer, organ failure and, if lacking effective treatment, even death. While numerous targeted antiviral therapies have been developed over the past century, many viral diseases still lack effective antivirals to date. Revisiting compounds approved for other applications offers accelerated development, and automated screening and data processing boost the feasibility of the re-purposing approach. Here, we extended our high-content image-based platform  on three human viruses differing in genome composition, envelope state, and tropism, namely human rhinovirus (RV), influenza A virus (IAV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Among the 1,280 mainly FDA-approved compounds, we identified potent inhibitors and even enhancers of multi-round infection propagation in vitro. The most potent inhibitors were 5-azacytidin against RV-A16, clotrimazole against IAV-WSN, and raltitrexed against HSV-1. Clobetasol was found to significantly enhance HSV-1 infection. Remarkably, Aminacrine, a topical antiseptic, inhibited all three viruses tested. Follow-up experiments of the highest-scoring modulators confirmed their performance.	Study

We have adapted the mouse kidney rudiment assay to generate renal organoids. To demonstrate that the organoid culture method of re-aggregated kidney rudiments in PDMS discs resulted in 3D kidney organoids with organotypic structures, we stained fixed six day old organoids for various developmental markers and imaged them with a light sheet fluorescent microscope. We have stained for the following markers: Megalin, Laminin, Cytokeratin, Pax2, Six2, Wt1, Synaptopodin and Nephrin and have also used the lectin stain PNA (peanut agglutinin).

The samples cultured at air liquid interface were gently removed from the membranes before starting the assay. The samples were incubated for one hour at 25oC with PBS containing 1uM 5(6)-Carboxyfluorescein (6-CF) and 20 ug/ml of PNA (Vector Laboratories). For the control samples, 2 mM probenecid was also added to the solution to inhibit the organic anion transport. After incubation, the samples were washed with ice cold PBS for 10 mins followed by an incubation with 8mM probenecid in PBS for 15 mins to arrest any transport. The functional assay was concluded by two PBS washes and samples were then embedded in 1.5% agarose for imaging.	Experiment

"We have adapted the mouse kidney rudiment assay to generate renal organoids. 24 hours after pelleting 100,000 mouse kidney cells, organoids had formed in the PDMS dishes. For the PNA vital stain test we used kidney cells from wildtype mice and for the tracking time series we used cells from the Wt1tm1Nhsn strain, expressing GFP together with the transcription factor Wt1. One organoid was embedded in a hydrogel matrix (1.5% Agarose + 3% gelatine). In the microscope chamber, the hydrogel cylinder was extruded from the capillary so that the hydrogel column containing the organoid was located outside the capillary and immersed in medium (phenol red-free MEM + 10% FBS, 1% pen/strep, 3ug/ml PNA-rh) at 37oC and with 5% CO2. We recorded z stacks of the spheroids from multiple angles every 30 mins to record the location of the GFP expressing cells in three dimensions over time. There are three time series. These are available in the subfolders ""Time PNA-rh vital"", ""Wt1-GFP PNA Time Series 1"" and ""Wt1-GFP PNA Time Series 2"".  The time series data was processed in Fiji by opening the green channel only, binning in X and Y by a factor of two and converting it to 8 bit for processing in TrackMate (v.2.8.2) where we used the LoG (Laplacian of Gaussian) Detector and LAP (Linear Assignment Problem) Tracker options.

903	idr0065-camsund-crispri	Time-resolved imaging-based CRISPRi screening	Our ability to connect genotypic variation to biologically important phenotypes has been seriously limited by the gap between live-cell microscopy and library-scale genomic engineering. Here, we show how in situ genotyping of a library of strains after time-lapse imaging in a microfluidic device overcomes this problem. We determine how 235 different CRISPR interference knockdowns impact the coordination of the replication and division cycles of Escherichia coli by monitoring the location of replication forks throughout on average >500 cell cycles per knockdown. Subsequent in situ genotyping allows us to map each phenotype distribution to a specific genetic perturbation to determine which genes are important for cell cycle control. The single-cell time-resolved assay allows us to determine the distribution of single-cell growth rates, cell division sizes and replication initiation volumes. The technology presented in this study enables genome-scale screens of most live-cell microscopy assays.	Study

1551	idr0071-feldman-crisprko	Optical pooled screens in human cells	Genetic screens are critical for the systematic identification of genes underlying cellular phenotypes. Pooling gene perturbations greatly improves scalability, but is not compatible with imaging of complex and dynamic cellular phenotypes. Here, we introduce a pooled approach for optical genetic screens in mammalian cells. We use targeted in situ sequencing to demultiplex a library of genetic perturbations following image-based phenotyping. We screened a set of 952 genes across millions of cells for involvement in NF-κB signaling by imaging the translocation of RelA (p65) to the nucleus. Screening at a single time point across 3 cell lines recovered 15 known pathway components, while repeating the screen with live-cell imaging revealed a novel role for Mediator complex subunits in regulating the duration of p65 nuclear retention. These results establish a new approach to perform highly multiplexed, image-based screens of spatially and temporally defined phenotypes with pooled libraries.	Study

1152	idr0086-miron-micrographs	Chromatin arranges in chains of mesoscale domains with nanoscale functional topography independent of cohesin	Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization plays a key role in regulating mammalian genome function, however many of its physical features at the single-cell level remain underexplored. Here we use 3D super-resolution and scanning electron microscopy to analyze structural and functional nuclear organization in somatic cells. We identify linked chromatin domains (CDs) composed of irregular ~200-300-nm-wide aggregates of nucleosomes that can overlap with individual topologically associating domains and are distinct from a surrounding RNA-populated interchromatin region. High-content mapping uncovers confinement of cohesin and active histone modifications to surfaces and enrichment of repressive modifications towards the core of CDs in both hetero- and euchromatic regions. This nanoscale functional topography is temporarily relaxed in postreplicative chromatin, but remarkably persists after ablation of cohesin. Our findings establish CDs as physical and functional modules of mesoscale genome organization.	Study

1305	idr0089-fischl-coldtemp	Cold-induced chromatin compaction and nuclear retention of clock mRNAs resets the circadian rhythm	Cooling patients to sub-physiological temperatures is an integral part of modern medicine. We show that cold exposure induces temperature-specific changes to the higher-order chromatin and gene expression profiles of human cells. These changes are particularly dramatic at 18°C, a temperature synonymous with that experienced by patients undergoing controlled deep-hypothermia during surgery. Cells exposed to 18°C exhibit largely nuclear-restricted transcriptome changes. These include the nuclear accumulation of core circadian clock suppressor gene transcripts, most notably REV-ERBα. This response is accompanied by compaction of higher-order chromatin and hindrance of mRNPs from engaging nuclear pores. Rewarming reverses chromatin compaction and releases the transcripts into the cytoplasm, triggering a pulse of suppressor gene proteins that resets the circadian clock. We show that cold-induced upregulation of REV-ERBα alone is sufficient to trigger this resetting. Our findings uncover principles of the cellular cold-response that must be considered for current and future applications involving therapeutic deep-hypothermia.	Study

1401	idr0095-ali-asymmetry	Inherent regulatory asymmetry emanating from network architecture in a prevalent autoregulatory motif	Predicting gene expression from DNA sequence remains a major goal in the field of gene regulation. A challenge to this goal is the connectivity of the network, whose role in altering gene expression remains unclear. Here, we study a common autoregulatory network motif, the negative single-input module, to explore the regulatory properties inherited from the motif. Using stochastic simulations and a synthetic biology approach in E. coli, we find that the TF gene and its target genes have inherent asymmetry in regulation, even when their promoters are identical; the TF gene being more repressed than its targets. The magnitude of asymmetry depends on network features such as network size and TF binding affinities. Intriguingly, asymmetry disappears when the growth rate is too fast or too slow and is most significant for typical growth conditions. These results highlight the importance of accounting for network architecture in quantitative models of gene expression.	Study

MarrowQuant discerns and quantifies the areas occupied by bone, adipocyte ghosts, hematopoietic cells and the interstitial/microvascular compartment. A separate feature, AdipoQuant, fragments adipocyte ghosts in H&E-stained sections of extramedullary adipose tissue sections to render adipocyte area and size distribution. Quantification of BM hematopoietic cellularity with MarrowQuant lies within the range of scoring by four independent pathologists, while quantification of the total adipocyte area in whole bone sections compares with volumetric measurements.

1601	idr0097-reicher-proteintag	Pooled protein tagging, cellular imaging, and in situ sequencing for monitoring drug action in real time	The levels and subcellular localizations of proteins regulate critical aspects of many cellular processes and can become targets of therapeutic intervention. However, high-throughput methods for unbiased discovery of proteins that change localization either by shuttling between compartments, by binding larger complexes or by localizing to distinct membraneless organelles are not available. Here we describe a scalable strategy to characterize effects on protein localizations and levels in response to different perturbations. We use CRISPR-Cas9 based intron tagging to generate cell pools expressing hundreds of GFP-fusion proteins from their endogenous promoters and monitor localization changes by time-lapse microscopy followed by clone identification using in situ sequencing. We show that this strategy can characterize cellular responses to drug treatment and thus identify non-classical effects such as modulation of protein-protein interactions, condensate formation and chemical degradation.

For this experiment, we seeded the cell pool in a single well of 384-well plate and imaged the entire well twice (0h and 3h timepoint, 289 fields of view per timepoint, raw tiff files were merged to 9 tiles per well). Cells in the same well were then fixed and we performed in situ sequencing to identify the expressed sgRNA in each cell indicating which protein is GFP tagged (7 cycles of in situ sequencing by synthesis, 289 fields of view per cycle,  raw tiff files were merged to 9 tiles per well).

1604	idr0098-huang-octmos	OCT-MoS, a dataset of mouse skin squamous cell carcinoma stages by full-field optical coherence tomography	The incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has increased in recent years, while it remains as an understudied subject. Current methods for the diagnose of skin cancer are either invasive, present a low resolution, or images that are difficult to interpret. Full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT) has proven its potential as a non-invasive imaging technique of epithelial tissue. The sub-micrometer resolution offered by FF-OCT is able to show fine features such as cell nuclei, blood vessels, and fibrous structures in the dermis. However, not many physicians are familiar with the images derived from this technique. Using a well-known mouse model of SCC, we acquired volumetric data from skin samples at different stages of the disease using our home-made FF-OCT system. We present OCT-Mouse Skin (OCT-MoS) dataset, a curated dataset of 3400 annotated tomograms distributed into four classes, representing different stages in the development of SCC: normal, dysplasia, papilloma, and SCC. This dataset has a high potential for reuse in areas such as cancer research, medical training, image processing, and deep learning.	Study

2054	idr0101-payne-insitugenomeseq	In situ genome sequencing resolves DNA sequence and structure in intact biological samples	Understanding genome organization requires integration of DNA sequence and 3D spatial context, however, existing genome-wide methods lack either base-pair sequence resolution or direct spatial localization. Here, we describe in situ genome sequencing (IGS), a method for simultaneously sequencing and imaging genomes within intact biological samples. We applied IGS to human fibroblasts and early mouse embryos, spatially localizing thousands of genomic loci in individual nuclei. Using these data, we characterized parent-specific changes in genome structure across embryonic stages, revealed single-cell chromatin domains in zygotes, and uncovered epigenetic memory of global chromosome positioning within individual embryos. These results demonstrate how in situ genome sequencing can directly connect sequence and structure across length scales from single base pairs to whole organisms.	Study

1501	idr0103-coomer-hiv1fusion/experimentA	Single-cell glycolytic activity regulates membrane tension and HIV-1 fusion	TZM-bl cells stably expressing CD4 and CCR5 receptors and charged with CCF2, were exposed to HIV-1 pseudoparticles where the Vpr is cloned with BlaM (Vpr-Blam) at MOI = 1. When treating the cells with 100 mM 2-Deoxyglucose (2DG), HIV-1 fusion is blocked. Successive treatment of these cells with 100, 200 and 400 ug/mL of Cholesterol rescues HIV-1 fusion. This experiment shows that cholesterol is key for HIV-1 fusion and that 2DG might downregulate the concentration of cholesterol in the plasma membrane of the host, impeding HIV-1 to effectively fuse in the host.  There are 3 different repeats and in each repeat 6 different experiments (images acquired in different conditions).	Experiment

1902	idr0110-rodermund-xistrna/experimentA	Time-resolved structured illumination microscopy reveals key principles of Xist RNA spreading	In this project, XX mESCs with inducible endogenous Xist RNA, as well as XY mESCs with inducible autosomal transgenic Xist RNA, were used to study the localisation, dynamics and spreading behaviour of Xist RNA during the early phases of XCI. The Bgl-stem-loop labelling system was used in this project to label endogenous Xist RNA. A transgene encoding the BglG-Halo fusion protein was engineered to be doxycycline inducible. Later, different mutant cell lines were created using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Considering the technical difficulties associated with live imaging of Xist foci, a different approach to studying Xist RNA dynamics was developed: RNA-SPLIT (Sequential Pulse Localisation Imaging over Time). In order to add temporal information one can make use of the fact that HaloTag technology enables addition of cell permeable ligands with different properties to cells, with excess ligand being washed out prior to fixation. Specifically, instead of a single HaloTag ligand, two different wavelength emitting HaloTag ligands were added sequentially after induction with doxycycline. Cells were induced for 1.5 h and 24 h before the start of the experiment to assess Xist localisation and dynamics in expansion and steady state respectively. Subsequent addition of the HaloTag ligands allowed for splitting the RNA into two differently labelled pools, pre-synthesised RNA labelled with Halo ligand 1 and newly synthesised RNA labelled with Halo ligand 2. This novel technique is especially powerful because variations of the set up can be used to study different aspects of RNA dynamics and localisation, and it can potentially be applied to any RNA and any stem-loop labelling system. Firstly, localisation of Xist to the X chromosome territory at the different stages of XCI and in different cellular backgrounds can be assessed by measuring the molecule density and volume of spread. Moreover, one can determine RNA turnover by scoring the number of pre-synthesised RNA molecules over time, while gradually increasing the staining time of newly synthesised RNA molecules for up to 4 h. Full turnover of the RNA can be assumed when no pre-synthesised RNA signal can be detected anymore. Turnover rates can be complemented by analysis of RNA transcription dynamics, quantified by scoring the number of newly synthesised RNA molecules while gradually increasing the staining time of newly synthesised RNA in 10 min intervals. Finally, RNA-SPLIT can be used to assess the localisation of newly synthesised RNA with respect to pre-synthesised RNA by measuring the distance of each newly synthesised molecule to the nearest pre-synthesised molecule. Image processing and analysis is critical for successful RNA-SPLIT experiments. After image acquisition with 3D-SIM, the data is reconstructed and undergoes quality checks through the SIMcheck plugin. Artefacts are reduced by generating modulation contrast maps and applying suitable and consistent filters to discard low modulation contrast signal. Then, background stemming from free diffusing BglG-Halo is discarded by manual thresholding. Channels are aligned using the open-source software package Chromagnon and EdU calibration data acquired on the date of image acquisition. In the final step of image processing, Xist territories are manually cropped. The volume of the cropped Xist territory gives first insights into the spreading volume of the RNA. To analyse the fully processed images, the signal is masked and the centroids of each molecule are determined by a Watershed algorithm. This allows for the counting of pre-synthesised and newly synthesised molecules at different time points and under various experimental conditions. RNA turnover and transcription dynamics can be deduced from this information. The localisation of each molecule in 3D determined by the Watershed algorithm can then be used to conduct NNA, where the distance of each newly synthesised molecule to its nearest neighbouring pre-synthesised molecule is measured. Variations of NNA, where distances between all RNA molecules or between the approximate transcription site and newly synthesised RNA are determined, can be used to examine RNA density and spreading behaviour. The development of this new tool for studying RNA localisation and dynamics allows for the addition of temporal resolution to super-resolved localisation microscopy data without the need for live cell imaging.

1851	idr0111-lee-cellmigration	Distinct Roles of Tumor Associated Mutations in Collective Cell Migration	Recent evidence suggests that groups of cells are more likely to form clinically dangerous metastatic tumors, emphasizing the importance of understanding mechanisms underlying collective behavior. The emergent collective behavior of migrating cell sheets in vitro has been shown to be disrupted in tumorigenic cells but the connection between this behavior and in vivo tumorigenicity remains unclear. We use particle image velocimetry to measure a multidimensional migration phenotype for genetically defined human breast epithelial cell lines that range in their in vivo behavior from non-tumorigenic to aggressively metastatic. By using cells with controlled mutations, we show that PTEN deletion enhances collective migration, while Ras activation suppresses it, even when combined with PTEN deletion. These opposing effects on collective migration of two mutations that are frequently found in patient tumors could be exploited in the development of novel treatments for metastatic disease. Our methods are based on label-free phase contrast imaging, and thus could easily be applied to patient tumor cells. The short time scales of our approach do not require potentially selective growth, and thus in combination with label-free imaging would allow multidimensional collective migration phenotypes to be utilized in clinical assessments of metastatic potential.

1903	idr0113-bottes-opcclones/experimentA	Live imaging of remyelination in the adult mouse corpus callosum	We genetically targeted OPCs using mice expressing a tamoxifen (Tam)-inducible Cre recombinase under the control of the endogenous Achaete-scute homolog 1 (Ascl1) promoter crossed with a tdTomato reporter mouse line (Ascl1-tdTomato mice). To induce focal demyelination in the CC, mice were injected with LPC in the posterior CC. Mice were implanted with a transcortical window allowing for optical access using 2-photon microscopy. Tamoxifen (TAM) was injected 2 and 3 days after LPC injection to induce sparse labeling of Ascl1-targeted OPCs. Labeled OPC clones were imaged every day up to two months.	Experiment

2401	idr0134-peters-bryophytes/experimentA	Reference bioimaging to assess the phenotypic trait diversity of bryophytes within the family Scapaniaceae	Representative voucher specimens were received from herbaria and fresh samples of Diplophyllum taxifolium, Scapania cuspiduligera, Scapania gymnostomophila and Scapania subalpina were additionally collected, put into envelopes on-site, identified and photographed afterwards. Information regarding the date, site (including geographical coordinates), habitat, substrate and other further information are available in the meta-data. For microscopy, a Zeiss Axio Scope.A1 HAL 100/HBO, 6x HD/DIC, M27, 10x/23 microscope with an achromatic-aplanatic 0.9 H D Ph DIC condenser was used with the objectives EC Plan Neofluar 2.5x/0.075 M27 (a=8.8mm), Plan-Apochromat 5x/0.16 M27 (a=12.1mm), Plan-Apochromat 10x/0.45 M27 (a=2.1mm), Plan-Apochromat 20x/0.8 M27 (a=0.55mm), and Plan-Apochromat 40x/0.95 Korr M27 (a=0.25mm) using the EC PN and the Fluar 40x/1.30 III and PA 40x/0.95 III filters for DIC. The conversion filter CB3 and the interference filter wideband green were used to improve digital reproduction of colors. For macroscopy and for preparing microscopy slides, a binocular microscope Zeiss Stemi 2000c was used (apochromatic Greenough system with a stereo angle of 11° and 100/100 switchover of camera and ocular viewing). For stand-alone macroscopic images, the objectives Canon MP-E 65mm 2.8 1-5x macro and Laowa 25mm 2.5-5.0x ultra-macro for Canon EF and the Canon EF-RF adapter. To acquire digital images, a full-frame, high-resolution camera (Canon EOS RP, 26 megapixel) was used and adapted to the microscopes using binocular phototubes with sliding prism 30°/23 (Axio Scope.A1) and 100:0/0:100 reversed image (Stemi 2000c) using 60-T2 camera adapter for Canon EOS and Canon EF-RF adapter. The objectives Canon MP-E and Laowa 25mm were adapted directly through the Canon EF-RF adapter. To construct images with extended depth of field using computational methods, multiple images were recorded at different focal planes. This “focus stacking” approach was automatized for macroscopy by attaching the camera to a Cognisys StackShot macro rail fixed on a Novoflex macro stand, and for microscopy by adapting a Cognisys StackShot motor to the fine adjustment of the microscope using two cogged wheels, one small wheel (1 cm diameter) adapted on the motor and one large wheel (8.5 cm diameter) on the fine adjustment of the microscope. The two cogged wheels were coupled with a toothed belt to obtain very fine step increments of the stepping motor for high magnifications. A Cognisys StackShot controller was used to control the amount and distance of the stepping motor with the following controller settings: Dist/Rev: 3200 stp, Backlash: 0 steps, # pics: 1, Tsettle: 100.0 ms, Toff: 450.0 ms, Auto Return: yes, Speed: 3000 st/sec, Tlapse: off, Tpulse: 800.0 ms, Tramp: 100 ms, Units: steps, Torque: 6, Hi Precision: Off, LCD Backlight: 10, Mode: Auto-Step using between 25 steps (magnification 1x) and 50 steps (magnification 25x) and 100 steps (magnification 400x) (number of steps depending on aperture settings and effective magnification). Raw images were recorded in CR3-format and pre-processed with Adobe Camera RAW. Non-destructive image enhancements such as corrections of the field curvature, removal of chromatic aberration, increase of contrast and brightness were performed in Adobe Camera RAW. Images were then exported into TIF-format and any image enhancement steps were recorded in individual XMP-files. Files containing multiple images of one object captured at different steps of the z-axis (for alter multi-focus image fusion) have been saved into one OME-TIFF file. Multi-focus image fusion was performed on the individual images in the z-stacks using the software Helicon Focus and by choosing the algorithms depth map and pyramid with different settings of radius (4, 8, 16, 24) and smoothing (2, 4). The best composite image was chosen manually and retained. When composite images contained specimen that were larger than the frame, several images were stitched together using the software Affinity Photo and the panorama stitching function. Images were manually segmented and interfering background removed using the flood select, brush selection and freehand selection tools in the software Affinity Photo. In order to determine the scale, a stage micrometre was photographed separately with any of the objectives and microscope combinations. The scale was calculated per pixel for each combination and scale bars were put post-hoc onto the segmented images using a simple Python script. Meta-data including species name, taxonomic rank information, voucher specimen id, image acquisition date, an object description including the name of the captured phenotypic properties, used objective-microscope combination and magnification were associated with any raw image based on unique species names and unique respective file names. Individual file names (variable file list), name within an image focus stack (variable stack name) and name within an image stitching stack (variable stitch name) were recorded additionally to facilitate subsequent automized image processing in workflows. A Python script was created to put individual images as part of image stacks into directories. The Python script parses the Label tag in the XMP-files. Any meta-data regarding image enhancement and non-destructive image processing were extracted from XMP-files using a simple Python script. The meta-data was saved in individual TSV-files and merged using a helper Python script. In order to improve data reuse and to enable linking bioimaging data to ecological data repositories such as GBIF, individual segmented images were associated with standardised geolocation information. Swiss Topo CH1903/LV03 coordinates were converted to WGS84 using Swisstopo-WGS84-LV0352. The segmented images and meta-data contained in a TSV file were uploaded to the Image Data Resource repository (IDR).	Experiment
